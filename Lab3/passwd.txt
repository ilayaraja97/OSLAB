a. The root owns the passwd file. The read write permissions are given, the owner name is given.
   -rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 54256 Mar 29  2016 /usr/bin/passwd is the output.
b. SUID permission is set ae fourth bit â€”so the file is executed as 'root'. The file should be opened as root is because only root should be able to modify it. A default use of this can be seen with the /usr/bin/passwd binary file. passwd needs to modify /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow which store account information and password hashes for all users and can only be modified by 'root'.
